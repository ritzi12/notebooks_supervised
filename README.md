# Supervised Learning Notebooks
It contains collection of notebooks and datasets for supervised learning algorithms implemented with various  case studies.
## List of Notebooks 
Few Notebooks are linked to Kaggle and few uploaded here in the repo

1. **Binary Classification and Metrics Tutorial** | [Github](https://github.com/ritzi12/notebooks_supervised/blob/main/binary_classifiers_classification_metrics_tutorial.ipynb) | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritzig/binary-classifiers-classification-metrics-tutorial) | Dataset
2. **Multiclass Classification** | [Github](https://github.com/ritzi12/notebooks_supervised/blob/main/multiclass_classification_metrics_tutorial_97.ipynb)  | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritzig/multiclass-classification-metrics-tutorial-97) | Dataset
 
   This notebook is a tutorial on various classifiers that can be used for multiclass classifications and also we will go through various classification metrics used to evaluate such a classifier.
3. **EDA USING SEABORN, Missing Value,Feature Selection** | [Github](https://github.com/ritzi12/notebooks_supervised/blob/main/eda_using_seaborn_missing_value_feature_selection.ipynb) | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritzig/eda-using-seaborn-missing-value-feature-selection) | Dataset
    
    This notebook attempts to carry out an exhaustive EDA with beginner friendly tutorial using SEABORN . This notebook is still in progress and further feature engineering , model building will be added to this eventually ! So let's hop on and explore the Spaceship Titanic Dataset!!
4. **EDA Using Plotly, Seaborn And Linear Reg Model** | Github | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritzig/eda-using-plotly-seaborn-and-linear-reg-model) | Dataset
5. **Classification Feature Selection : SHAP Tutorial** | Github | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritzig/classification-feature-selection-shap-tutorial) | Dataset

   This notebook aims to understand and use SHap package for this mobile classification dataset in order to understand what are the factors which influence a mobile to be in a particular price range . Which features of a mobile affects is price and whter they impact it positively or negatively.
   
6. **Feature Interaction Tutorial(PDP,SHAP)Ensemble Model** | Github | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritzig/feature-interaction-tutorial-pdp-shap-ensemble-mod) | Dataset

    This notebook is writtern for Tabular Playground Series May 2022 edition. Through this notebook we aim to discover various methods to visualise and understand the feature interactions and how to incorporate them for feature engineering.
 
    The notebook has end -to -end tutorial covers and explains what is feature interaction and how to analyse and model them using boosting models.
 
    It consists of detailed EDA , Feature Interaction Analysis, Ensemble Modelling
 
7. **RegressionAssumptions And Mathematical Formulation** | [Github](https://github.com/ritzi12/notebooks_supervised/blob/main/MultipleRegression.ipynb) | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritzig/regressionassumptions-and-mathematical-formulation#Regularised-Regression) | Dataset
