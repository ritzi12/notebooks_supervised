# Supervised Learning Notebooks
It contains collection of notebooks and datasets for supervised learning algorithms implemented with various  case studies.
## List of Notebooks 
Few Notebooks are linked to Kaggle and few uploaded here in the repo

1. **Binary Classification and Metrics Tutorial** | Github | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritzig/binary-classifiers-classification-metrics-tutorial) | Dataset
2. **Multiclass Classification** | Github | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritzig/multiclass-classification-metrics-tutorial-97) | Dataset
 
   This notebook is a tutorial on various classifiers that can be used for multiclass classifications and also we will go through various classification metrics used to evaluate such a classifier.
3. **EDA USING SEABORN, Missing Value,Feature Selection** | Github | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritzig/eda-using-seaborn-missing-value-feature-selection) | Dataset
    
    This notebook attempts to carry out an exhaustive EDA with beginner friendly tutorial using SEABORN . This notebook is still in progress and further feature engineering , model building will be added to this eventually ! So let's hop on and explore the Spaceship Titanic Dataset!!
4. **EDA Using Plotly, Seaborn And Linear Reg Model** | Github | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritzig/eda-using-plotly-seaborn-and-linear-reg-model) | Dataset
5. **Classification Feature Selection : SHAP Tutorial** | Github | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritzig/classification-feature-selection-shap-tutorial) | Dataset

   This notebook aims to understand and use SHap package for this mobile classification dataset in order to understand what are the factors which influence a mobile to be in a particular price range . Which features of a mobile affects is price and whter they impact it positively or negatively.
   
6. **Feature Interaction Tutorial(PDP,SHAP)Ensemble Model** | Github | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritzig/feature-interaction-tutorial-pdp-shap-ensemble-mod) | Dataset
7. **Classification Feature Selection : SHAP Tutorial** | Github | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ritzig/classification-feature-selection-shap-tutorial) | Dataset
